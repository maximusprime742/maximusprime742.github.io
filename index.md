# Projects

**Music Through the Decades**

Final project for introduction to data science. An in depth tutorial on how to use the Spotify API to take popular music in the last seven decades through the data science pipeline. This includes data collection, cleaning, visualization, and analysis. Created with Python. Project can be found [here](https://maximgeronime.com/final_tutorial/).

**vRchery - Group Project**

A virtual reality game that involved shooting targets with a bow. Consisted of fully animated bow and arrow mechanics, multiple difficulty ratings, and a dynamic scoring system. Created in Unity and used C#. Project can be found [here](https://github.com/maximusprime742/vRchery).

**3-Bit Computer in Minecraft**

Created a functional 3-bit computer in Minecraft using redstone. Constructed individual components (ALU, ROM, etc) then strung them all together at the end. This is possible because Minecraft is Turing Complete!

# Experience

**Philmont Scout Ranch - Ranger Trainer**

Summer 2021 - In Progress

Trained, coached, mentored, and evaluated eight Rangers (see description below) over the course of the summer. Taught classes throughout the summer on topics such as conflict resolution.

# Awards

**Eagle Scout** - Awarded in 2017

As a Boy Scout, I developed many important life skills, earned all the necessary badges, took part in countless hours of community service, and held various high-level leadership positions within the troop to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout.
My final project involved installation of a 25-foot flag pole and landscaping at my local pool.

# Interests

Anything computer science related! I'm not totally sure yet what I like so I want to investigate as many areas as I can to get a feel for what is available and what catches my eye.

# Hobbies

### Exploring
I love doing anything in the outdoors. My favorite activities include rock climbing, backpacking, and mountain biking.

### Creating
I have had numerous aquariums of various sizes over the past 6 years filled with fish, shrimp, plants, and/or snails. I enjoy baking and brewing kombucha as well. Bread is my favorite food to bake, but I am always interested in trying new recipes. I am also a big fan of LEGO and frequently build with them when I have time.  A LEGO creation I have made can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SiWOdRe88m-0R7zn1SBCsStZWxWuopdn/view?usp=sharing).
