# Skills
Some of my technical skills include, but are not limited to:
- Java
- Ruby
- Python
- OCaml
- C
- C#
- R
- Git
- MATLAB
- Unity

I have a number of soft skills as well that have been developed through my years in Scouts as well as my summer working at Philmont. I am an excellent teacher, an effective leader, and have lots of experience working in groups to achieve a common goal.

# Projects

**vRchery - Group Project**

A virtual reality game that involved shooting targets with a bow. Consisted of fully animated bow and arrow mechanics, multiple difficulty ratings, and a dynamic scoring system. Created in Unity and used C#. Project can be found [here](https://github.com/Daniel-Mansfield/vRchery).

**3-Bit Computer in Minecraft**

Created a functional 3-bit computer in Minecraft using redstone. Constructed individual components (ALU, ROM, etc) then strung them all together at the end. This is possible because Minecraft is Turing Complete!

# Experience 

**Philmont Scout Ranch - Wilderness Adventure and Backpacking Guide**

Summer 2019, Summer 2020 **(Cancelled due to COVID-19)**

Guided groups of 8-12 scouts and adults through the Rocky Mountains for 3 days at a time. Educated participants on hard skills such as cooking, cleaning, and campsite setup as well as soft skills like trail etiquette and teamwork. Ensured the group's safety and developed the group dynamic.

# Awards

**Eagle Scout** - Awarded in 2017

As a Boy Scout, I developed many important life skills, earned all the necessary badges, took part in countless hours of community service, and held various high-level leadership positions within the troop to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout.
My final project involved instalation of a 25-foot flag pole and landscaping at my local pool.

### Creating
I have had numerous aquariums of various sizes over the past 6 years filled with fish, shrimp, plant, and/or snails. I enjoy baking too. Bread is my favorite but I always like trying new recipes. I am also a big fan of LEGO and frequently build with them when I have time.

I have played trombone and ukulele for many years. I know a bit of guitar and am currently learning piano. My goal is to one day have my own grand piano and be able to play it!
