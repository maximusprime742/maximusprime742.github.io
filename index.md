# Projects

**Music Through the Decades**

Final project for introduction to data science. An in depth tutorial on how to use the Spotify API to take popular music in the last seven decades through the data science pipeline. This includes data collection, cleaning, visualization, and analysis. Created with Python. Project can be found [here](https://maximgeronime.com/final_tutorial/)

**vRchery - Group Project**

A virtual reality game that involved shooting targets with a bow. Consisted of fully animated bow and arrow mechanics, multiple difficulty ratings, and a dynamic scoring system. Created in Unity and used C#. Project can be found [here](https://github.com/maximusprime742/vRchery).

**3-Bit Computer in Minecraft**

Created a functional 3-bit computer in Minecraft using redstone. Constructed individual components (ALU, ROM, etc) then strung them all together at the end. This is possible because Minecraft is Turing Complete!

# Experience 

**Philmont Scout Ranch - Wilderness Adventure and Backpacking Guide**

Summer 2019, Summer 2020 **(Cancelled due to COVID-19)**

Guided groups of 8-12 scouts and adults through the Rocky Mountains for 3 days at a time. Educated participants on hard skills such as cooking, cleaning, and campsite setup as well as soft skills like trail etiquette and teamwork. Ensured the group's safety and developed the group dynamic.

# Awards

**Eagle Scout** - Awarded in 2017

As a Boy Scout, I developed many important life skills, earned all the necessary badges, took part in countless hours of community service, and held various high-level leadership positions within the troop to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout.
My final project involved installation of a 25-foot flag pole and landscaping at my local pool.

### Exploring
I love doing anything in the outdoors. My favorite activities include rock climbing, backpacking, and mountain biking. A LEGO creation I have made can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SiWOdRe88m-0R7zn1SBCsStZWxWuopdn/view?usp=sharing)

### Creating
I have had numerous aquariums of various sizes over the past 6 years filled with fish, shrimp, plant, and/or snails. I enjoy baking too. Bread is my favorite but I always like trying new recipes. I am also a big fan of LEGO and frequently build with them when I have time.

I have played trombone and ukulele for many years. I know a bit of guitar and am currently learning piano. My goal is to one day have my own grand piano and be able to play it!
